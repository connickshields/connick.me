<h3><mark>Hidden Infrastructure</mark><br/></h3>
<h4>2023–present</h4>
A website I'm currently working on which explores the concept of hidden infrastructure in our world (like unseen weather stations, microwave communication networks, and transit ventilation shafts). <a target="_blank" href="https://hiddeninfra.com">Check it out.</a><br/>

<h3><mark>MapQuest {{< icon "discord" >}} Bot</mark></h3>
<h4>2022</h4>
A Discord bot that I wrote in JavaScript, the project powered an in-person geographic photo-based scavenger hunt that I organized for my friends to play in August 2022. The purpose of the bot was to manage scorekeeping and allow approval or rejection of location captures. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/connickshields/mapquest-bot">Sneak a peek.</a><br/>

<h3><mark>Vroom</mark></h3>
<h4>2017–2018</h4>
Crafted by a team of 5 in JavaScript with React Native and Firebase, Vroom was my capstone software engineering project in college. Over the course of a year, we learned about various software engineering best practices while programming the final version. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eltoncrego/revi-tech-web">Take a look.</a>
