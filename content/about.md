<h4>Citeline, 2023–present  •  Product Security Engineer</h4>
I am helping to build the Product Security program from the ground up, which includes OWASP SAMM assessments, CI/CD pipeline improvements, SAST, DAST, SCA, vulnerability management, and incident response functions. I also work closely with others in the Information Security organization to improve the overarching security posture of the business.<br/>

<h4>Smartcar, 2021–2022  •  Software Engineer</h4>
As a member of the platform team, I was responsible for the API product itself as well as company infrastructure and internal developer tooling. Primarily working in JavaScript & TypeScript with PostgreSQL, I led development of 5 new OEM platforms (for 10+ brands), utilizing AWS Lambda functions and redis pubsub for authentication flows that required advanced logic handling. I also fleshed out two internal Slack bots which helped improve on-call monitoring and response times.<br/>

<h4>Baton Systems, 2019–2020  •  Software Engineer</h4>
Using Java alongside ActiveMQ and MySQL, I was responsible for designing and implementing Springboot REST APIs for financial asset management web applications. I also led a project that used Netflix's <a target="_blank" href="https://conductor.netflix.com">Conductor</a> workflow orchestration engine to run functions relevant to specific business use cases, including MFA authentication and transaction settlement. Additionally, I spearheaded integration of <a target="_blank" href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> into Kubernetes clusters to gather service health metrics and enable painless distributed tracing across applications.<br/>
