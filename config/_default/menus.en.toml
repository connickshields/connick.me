# -- Main Menu --
# The main menu is displayed in the header at the top of the page.
# Acceptable parameters are name, pageRef, page, url, title, weight.
#
# The simplest menu configuration is to provide:
#   name = The name to be displayed for this menu link
#   pageRef = The identifier of the page or section to link to
#
# By default the menu is ordered alphabetically. This can be
# overridden by providing a weight value. The menu will then be
# ordered by weight from lowest to highest.

# [[main]]

[[main]]
  name = "home"
  pageRef = "/"
  weight = 10

[[main]]
  name = "resume"
  pageRef = "resume"
  weight = 15

[[main]]
  name = "projects"
  pageRef = "projects"
  weight = 20


# [[main]]
#   identifier = "search"
#   weight = 99
#   [main.params]
#     action = "search"


# -- Footer Menu --
# The footer menu is displayed at the bottom of the page, just before
# the copyright notice. Configure as per the main menu above.

[[footer]]
  name = "GitHub"
  url = "https://github.com/connickshields/connick.me"
  weight = 10
  [footer.params]
    icon = "github"
    showName = false
    target = "_blank"
